  ## PIONEER p3dx ##
The code for the Pioneer p3dx is able to control the speed of the left and right motors, utilize the ultrasonic sensors, and capture images (given that a vision
sensor has been set up in Coppelia)

  ## UR10 robotic arm ##
The code for the UR10 robotic arm is able to control each joint of the robotic arm, based on user input (in degrees that is later converted to radians). The .py script is executable
in any terminal program.
A linear control system (using x,y,z coordinates instead of angles) is coming soon.

**SIMULATIONS IN COPPELIA MUST ALREADY BE RUNNING FOR REMOTE API CONNECTION TO WORK**
**sim.py, simConst.py, rempoteApi.dll must all be in workspace directory**
